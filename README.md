The project has been completed in accordance to the assignment description by CodeCademy.

## Beyond
The end of the project encouraged to keep adding trivia questions and features.\
I have yet to further expand on the project beyond the tutorial but had a few ideas.

### Ideas for more functionality:
* [ ] High score list with the latest attempts or a local save?
* [ ] Theme switcher within the actionbar? Light and dark toggle button?
* [ ] Another color for submit-button whilst player has not chosen an answer.
* [ ] Pick how many questions to run?
* [ ] Being able to chose a theme for the questions on start-up?
* [ ] Able to chose one or several themes, if several randomly picks a number of them.
* [ ] Need another layout for the theme view? New classes as well.

### Themes:
* [ ] Food
* [ ] Cultural
* [ ] Movies
* [ ] Memes
